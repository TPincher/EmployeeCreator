    21/03/2024
    Created the 'employees' table in the backend, with controller, service and repo. Yet to add the 'type' table and link it over, once that's hooked up it'll be time to move on to the front end side of the application.

    23/03/2024
    Backend completed, ran into some real trouble trying to link tables over - issue came from having FK column name and another column in the linked table as the same name.
    Started the front-end, service mappings completed
    Basic page layout completed
    Data successfully being called - will check all CRUD tomorrow but it's working in Postman so no problems expected.
    Majority of work from here on out will be styling and testing
